            <p>I am currently employed as a front end developer in Cincinnati, OH. I love working with React and I am always working to improve my skills. React is my language of choice for my current projects. I have also started working with Node.js and Express to better understand full stack development. I am continuing to learn Node and Express, which I would like to combine with my React skills to create more complex and robust full stack applications.</p>
